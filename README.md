# Icon Framework

This is a lightweight framework for easily integrating icons into web pages. It provides a simple way to add stylish icons using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To use this framework, follow these steps:

1. Include the CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML file:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerora98/rsIcons/main/rsIcons.css">
    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerora98/rsIcons/main/rsIcons.main.js"></script>
    ```

2. Add an element with the class `rsIcon` followed by the specific icon class. For example, to add a calendar icon, use:

    ```html
    <div class="rsIcon rsCalendar"></div>
    ```

3. Customize the appearance of the icons by modifying the CSS classes or adding your own styles.
